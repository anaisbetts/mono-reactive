mono-reactive aims to provide Reactive Extension (Rx) [*1] features to the
Mono world.

Right now it is almost about System.Reactive.dll implementation, but I'm
looking forward to seeing it running ReativeUI [*2] for MonoTouch as well as
Mono for Android support.

Not a few things are still not implemented, and there are many things known
to fail. Also since I'm pretty much newbie in Rx land, there are likely
stupid implementation and nasty hacks. Patches are welcome.
